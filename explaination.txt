The answer to the question depends greatly on how you define certain terms, especially EGG. Defining eggs as shell-covered life supporting systems for embryos laid on
land leads us to consider the amniotic eggs, which had evolved into existence as far as 312 million years ago. On the contrary chickens, as we know them today, 
originated only 58000 years ago. But if you define the egg in the question as specifically the chicken eggs that we see today, then it most probably came into existence
only after the chicken. Since the general perception of egg is the one with the former definition, I conclude that eggs evolutionarily came into existence far before
chickens.
